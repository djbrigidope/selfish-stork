# By copying and pasting the text from the HTML version of Figure 17, use echo
# to make a file called sonnet_1_complete.txt containing the full (original)
# text of Shakespeare’s first sonnet. Hint: You may recall getting stuck when
# echo was followed by an unmatched double quote (Section 1.2 and Box 4),
# as in echo ", but in fact this construction allows you to print out a
# multi-line block of text. Just remember to put a closing quote at the end,
# and then redirect to a file with the appropriate name. Check that the contents
# are correct using cat (Figure 14).
